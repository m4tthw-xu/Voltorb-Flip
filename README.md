# Voltorb-Flip
This is a clone of the Voltorb Flip minigame first seen in Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver.

# How to Play
This game is sorta similar to Sudoku. There is a 5x5 grid, and the goal is to uncover all the '2s' and '3s' without uncovering any '0s' (also called bombs). The 
'total points' to 'bombs' ratio is shown on the ends of each row and column. Points are recieved multiplicat-ably, meaning that uncovering a 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3 would 
net 1x3x2x1x1x3 points or 18 points total. However, if the player uncovers a '0', the entire product is set to 0 and the board is reset. Uncovering '1s' do nothing 
to advance the player's score, but they could lead to clues as to where other '2s' and '3s' or 'bombs' could be.
